    <h3>Pequeño Viaje</h3>
    <h5><i>June 22nd, 2015</i></h5>
    <br>

    <p>The past ten days have been wonderful, with a fair share of surprises.</p>
    
    <p>Surprise #1:
        I went bungee jumping. If you know me well, you’ll know that I have a slight fear of heights. I always think people should go out of their comfort zones, so I went 405 ft straight up out of mine. What an experience that was. The next day, I left for Guayaquil, Ecuador to meet up with a friend from Canada. After two days in Guayaquil, I was planning on continuing my travels to Máncora, Peru.</p>

    <p>Surprise #2:
        I was able to get through customs without a hiccup completely in Spanish! Even though I know I am able to have broken conversations with people it was great to actually do something with that knowledge. Every time I speak with anyone from a Spanish speaking country, the minute they find out I speak some Spanish they say “entonces ahora hablamos en español” and from then on our entire conversation is in Spanish.</p>

    <p>Surprise #3:
        A friend I have had since I was 5 years old, Ben, messaged me the night before I was planning on leaving saying he was coming to Guayaquil the next day so I stayed and hung out with him for two days! We rented bikes and biked to Isla Santay, which was absolutely gorgeous. His birthday was his second day in Guayaquil, so I wanted to stay and celebrate his birthday with him.</p>

    <p>Surprise #4:
        Bars/clubs in Guayaquil are all closed on Sundays, most are closed on Mondays, and the ones that are open on Monday all close at midnight. We walked into the only bar we could find with any people in it – little did we know it was a Karaoke bar. Certainly not how any of us expected his 20th birthday party to turn out.</p>

    <p>Surprise #5:
        Ben was travelling with a friend of his, but after meeting up with me he changed his travel plans and came with me to Máncora! We stayed at Loki, a bit of a party hostel. In Máncora there is a girl from Newfoundland living there so the three of us hung out quite a bit and she showed us around town, setting us up with some surfing lessons.</p>

    <p>Surprise #6:
        When I went surfing, I was able to stand up and ride the wave on my very first attempt. Surfing is so much fun – I could definitely see myself living in a surfing spot at some point in my life. I was sore all over my body afterwards. My ribs hurt from lying on the board, my shoulders from paddling, but feet from rocks, and neck from looking up while paddling.</p>

    <p>Surprise #7:
        On Friday, June 19th, I received an email from the Ivey School of Business with an offer for admission for the fall of 2015 to the HBA program! Starting September, I’ll be commencing the business portion of my dual degree.</p>

    <p>Surprise #8:
        All of a sudden, I’ve been in South America for 7 weeks. I’m over halfway through my time here. I’m finished all of the intermediate Spanish courses, so I just have advanced remaining and it’s only the subjunctive verbs (which are supposed to be hard, but the book is quite small). After I finish all of the lessons, I may continue with some practical classes, but I may also just try and practice on my own.</p>

    <p>I’m quite excited to get back to Cusco, I realized how much I love the city after leaving. As time goes on, I learn more and more about Peru. It’s quite frustrating because I don’t have the time (or money) to do everything I would like to do though. I suppose that just means I’ll have to come back sometime.</p>

    <p>Until next post!</p>
