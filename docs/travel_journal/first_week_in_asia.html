    <h3>First Week in Asia</h3>
    <h5><i>May 9th, 2016</i></h5>
    <br>

    <p>I've been in China for a full week, and at this rate it's going to be an incredible summer.</p>

    <p>I landed in Hong Kong after a direct flight form San Francisco, where I spent three fantastic days at the Cansbridge Fellowship Conference. The flight was painfully long, as I was sitting next to a two-year-old that audibly hated flying. He sounded like he didn't know how to cry... He would just close his eyes and shriek for a little while every now and again. As brutal as it was to sit through it, I can only imagine how the poor parents were feeling.</p>

    <p>When we finally touched down, I had to take a short ferry ride from the airport to Shenzhen. My body had no idea what time it was supposed to be, taking off at 1:10pm, landing at 6:40pm the next day, but only being in the air for 14.5 and gaining 30.5. Luckily, I had two free days to adjust to the time. My office and apartment are both located in the Shekou region of Shenzhen, which I'm really liking. There are lots of expats that live here, so it feels somewhat westernized. There's a Starbucks, McDonald's Pizza Hut, and KFC all in the plaza close to my work. Certainly not what I was expecting.</p>

    <p>On the ferry from Hong Kong to Shenzhen I met a family from Seattle that was extremely helpful, adding me to the couchsurfing wechat group and giving me some tips for where to live, what to do, etc. The father (Mike) works with Microsoft as a VP of Global Device Sales and Partnerships, so he had some great suggestions on where to look to get into the startup and tech scene here, which is absolutely massive.</p>

    <p>I stayed at an AirBnB for my first four nights, just on a pullout couch in a living room. My two hosts, Sara and Yuki, were very accommodating. We had several meals together, and they laughed at my struggles using chopsticks. The two of them work full-time, so I was on my own during the days. I spent the first day sorting out lots of things - places to eat, grocery stores, bars, banks, shops, then got a haircut and found a place for dry cleaning.</p>

    <p>The haircut was quite an experience. I saw the price for "non-members" was 138RMD and my immediate thought was that it was really expensive I quickly realized it's only around $23 Canadian, which is roughly the same as at home. I really needed a haircut before starting work, so I figured I may as well. The staff took my bookbag and put it in a locked closet, then gave me a silk robe to put on over my clothes. They walk me over to an area where there's eight beds all set out and tell me to lie down, I figured they were just going to rinse my hair before cutting, but wow, was I ever wrong. It ended up being a a shampoo, head massage, neck massage, and arm massage. After however long that took, I got a quick haircut, then back for anoher rinse. The whole process was around an hour, and I was even offered coffee and a glass of water. Now I understand why it was so "expensive." Turns out the vast majority of places that cut hair are like this here. Who would've thought.</p>

    <p>I didn't do much the next day. I just decided to stay in and fix up my <a href="resume.html">resume page</a>. I blitzed through the HTML & CSS course on Codeacademy, then decided to do some coding from scratch to practice and what better place to do so than my own website. Check out what I changed it to!</p>

    <p>Thursday, May 5th, I started work as an intern in the Economics and Reserves department. HR hadn't answered my most recent emails, so I didn't know what time I was supposed to be at the office, which floor I was on, what I was supposed to wear, or what I was doing. I showed up at 8am, and it was a ghost town. I decided to go and grab a bit more for breakfast and head back to the office around 8:45, and then there were lots of people around. The reception knew who I am, and shoed me to my office. <em>I have my own office.</em> Pretty cool. I meet the people I'm going to be working with - Dan and Jingwei, and my manager, John. Seems like a great team to be a part of. Dan showed me around then I spend the rest of the day getting familiar with the company's operations and budget model.</p>

    <p>On Thursday night Sara took me to an apartment that had a spare room. Three guys live there and it looked like a great location. The guys seemed like good guys, so I moved in the next day. Even though my bedroom is smaller than my office, the rent is crazy cheap in an area where renting is brutally expensive. The two British guys, Warren and James, needed to pick up some things on Saturday so I tagged along and got to see a real Chinese marketplace &#8212; it was awesome. Sunday I went to Huaqiangbei, the largest electronic market in the world and wow, it was unbelievably cool. Any electronic component or device you can imagine was there and was dirt cheap.</p>

    <p>Sunday night there was a CouchSurfer meet-up at a jazz bar which was great! I got to meet interesting people from all over, and made some friends that will likely turn into good hiking buddies. I arrived at the meet-up pretty early, so I realized after about two songs that they were playing Michael Buble's Christmas album on repeat... Definitely questionable for May, but to be fair I did stay there and write the majority of this post there.</p>

    <p>Well, that's all for my first week in China! My Internet access is quite limited so apologies if I'm slow getting back to you. Cheers!</p>
