    <h5><i>June 12th, 2016</i></h5>
    <br>

    <p>On the 8th of June, I learned that the 9th was the dragon boat festival and all of China got the day off. The 9th was a Thursday, and so instead of taking Thursday off, working Friday, then having the weekend off, the entire country does what makes a lot more sense. Take off Friday then work Sunday.</p>

    <p>After just learning that I had the next two days off work, I started chatting with another Cansbridge Fellow in a city nearby (Guangzhou) about somewhere we could visit. I had heard about these incredible mountain ranges near a city called Shaoguan, and after looking into it a little bit we were set on going there. Google turn up images like this for the “rainbow mountains.”</p>

    <div class="blog_picture">
        <img src="../../img/blog_img/Danxia/rainbow_mountains.jpg" id="picture_square">
    </div>

    <p>It was decided. This place looked unbelievable – and for good reason. The actual mountain ranges weren’t like that at all, but it is still a UNESCO world heritage site and absolutely beautiful. I booked tickets to get there at work on the 8th, and after work packed my bags and caught a bus to Guangzhou to stay with Will for a night before heading out the next morning for Danxia. We arrived in Danxia after several hours of trains and busses, so after we found a hostel to spend the night at we decided to go for a quick hike into the park. Visitor passes were good for two days, so it worked perfectly. There is basically nothing in this town aside from the park, so finding the entrance was easy. As soon as you got into the park you crossed a bridge and entered into the tourist trap area. There were lots of boats and restaurants, but the water really didn’t look nice.</p>

    <p>After 20 minutes of walking we came to the picture below on the left, and a few minutes after we arrived at the view point for the “male stone.” I don’t think the name needs an explanation…</p>

        <img src="../../img/blog_img/Danxia/other_view_male_stone.jpg" id="picture_rectangle">
    </div>

    <p>We kept hiking up a bit further and got to a very narrow path, which definitely made me a little uneasy with such a steep drop. But hey, the view was nice.</p>

    <div class="blog_picture">
        <img src="../../img/blog_img/Danxia/left_view_path.jpg" id="picture_rectangle">
        <img src="../../img/blog_img/Danxia/right_view_path.jpg" id="picture_rectangle">
    </div>

    <p>At this point we decided it probably wouldn’t be good to hike in the dark, so we headed back to our hostel. After hanging out for a little while, making some friends and playing card games, Will and I decided to go grab a bite to eat. We figured we would just go somewhere for dinner, grab a quick beer, then head back and get to bed early. When we were walking past the very limited selection of restaurants we saw one with live music, so we went in. The second we walked in we were greeted with smiles and and stares. Immediately one person came up to us welcoming us, and showed us to a table very enthusiastically. Before we had menus, another person from the bar came over and started chatting a little bit. He asked us what we would like to drink, and that he wanted to get it for us. He refused to let us pay, and after we said a cheap beer, he said they didn’t have it. Instead, he brought back an entire bottle of Jim Bean Bourbon, just for me and Will. When we asked for the food menu, there seemed to be a very limited selection so we got our new friend to recommend some things and we just went for it. Didn’t quite know what was coming. Turned out to just be a dish of peanuts, and cucumber with soya sauce. Hardly what I would consider dinner.</p>

    <p>We quickly realized that it wasn’t just live music, but it was basically an open mic night. The guy that bought us the bottle of bourbon was urging us to sing something, so we ended up singing a few songs. As soon as we started, every phone in the bar was out recording us. It turned into some Chinese people requesting songs, playing them, and eventually getting a bunch of people up on the stage and playing some songs. We danced, sang, and drank the night away. Pretty unexpected hilarious night. Luckily, through all the madness Will managed to grab one picture:</p>

    <p>We eventually got back to the hostel and went straight to bed. The next morning, we got up around 9, grabbed a quick bite, and headed to the mountain. The plan was to head to the top of a mountain we hadn’t visited yet. We knew you could either take the trail up or a gondola lift, but wanted to hike it. It was really quite remarkable how steep it was…</p>

        <img src="../../img/blog_img/Danxia/steep_stairs.jpg" id="picture_vertical_rectangle">
    </div>

    <p>We saw some interesting structures on our way up, and also saw a few Buddhist monks. Even though certain parts of it were decently crowded, it was very peaceful.</p>

    <div class="blog_picture">

        <img src="../../img/blog_img/Danxia/mountain_temple1.jpg" id="picture_vertical_rectangle">
    </div>

    <p>The peak of the mountain was well worth the steep climb. There was a cool little temple at the top, surrounded by beautiful green views. It’s a shame the scale is completely lost in pictures, but it was pretty massive.</p>

        <img src="../../img/blog_img/Danxia/danxia_view.jpg" id="picture_rectangle">
    </div>    

    <p>Will and I were repeatedly asked for pictures throughout the hike and atop the mountain. I figured it would happen in China, but Shenzhen has a lot of expats so I had not yet been asked for any pictures. Even though it was just a quick trip, it was nice to get the smell of a city off of me (as me dad would say).</p>
