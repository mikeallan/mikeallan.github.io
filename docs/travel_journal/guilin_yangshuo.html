    <h5><i>July 3rd, 2016</i></h5>
    <br>

    <p>Finding out there is a long weekend coming up when you didn’t expect it is always great news, but it was especially great when I found out I had the Friday off on the weekend I was planning to go to Guilin and Yangshuo. The people I was going with had to work part of the day Friday though, so we caught a 3:00 train. We got to Guillin at 7:30ish, and went straight to a hostel called Wada Hostel. It was quite nice and fairly cheap (50¥ per night). I loved how they had flags from around the world painted on the walls that you could sign though, thought that was so cool.</p>

    <p>Waiting for Mickie to arrive, the four of us (Grayson, Will, Rakan, and me) played cards against humanity. She got to the hostel around 2:30, so we went to bed pretty soon after she got there. The next day we wanted to try and get out to Yangshuo, because everyone always said to get there as fast as possible and not to spend time in Guilin. We had been told you can go to a place halfway between Guilin and Yangshuo and take a bamboo boat the rest of the way, so we wanted to do that. When we step off the bus we were bombarded with people trying to sell us a variety of useless things. They actually followed us around for a bit while we were trying to figure out where to buy tickets and such. Eventually we asked how much a flower headband cost and it was only 3¥, so we each got one. </p>

    <p>When we finally figured out the ticket situation, it was not at all what we had been told it was. It only brought you down the river and back, and it was MUCH more expensive than we had been told. You could only have a maximum of four people in a boat, so that was another annoyance. We walked down to the dock and saw a ton of boats and hoped we could get someone to take the five of us for cheaper on one boat, but there was no chance that was going to happen unfortunately.</p>

    <p>After getting a little bit frustrated with being misinformed, having our plans kinda messed up, we eventually got on the boats and everything was all good. Stunningly beautiful, it made all the inconveniences and delays not matter. Absolutely fantastic day.</p>

    <p>We got to Yangshuo late in the afternoon and just checked out the markets and what there was to see in the town after checking into Monkey Jane’s hostel. The hostel was crazy cheap (25¥ per night) and was pretty lively. We hung around the rooftop bar for a while, met some new people, played some foosball, then went out and checked out the streets of Yangshuo at night.</p>

    <p>The next morning, we got the hostel reception to help us rent some mopeds. They were 60¥ for the day, and it definitely made this afternoon one of my favourite out of all my time in China. For some reason the bikes they gave us all had the union jack painted on… Unsure why.</p>

    <p>We grabbed lunch at a tourist attraction place where we would walk through some caves and eventually get to a mud bath, and a hot spring. It was pretty cool because you could float in the mud, but it really wasn’t exactly warm.</p>

    <p>We rode out bikes out into the countryside for a while, going down side roads just to see what would be there. We got around some pretty cool villages, and eventually headed back to Yangshuo to catch our transport to the train station. We stopped for a last few pictures on a bridge, and they were selling cups of freshly cut mango. It was a struggle to get me to stop eating it long enough for a picture.</p>
