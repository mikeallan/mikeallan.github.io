    <h3>Lake Titicaca and Bolivia</h3>
    <h5><i>August 3rd, 2015</i></h5>
    <br>

    <p>I decided to spend my last two weeks in Peru travelling around, and am I ever glad I did that. On my last day before heading out for a while, we ventured to Sacsaywaman for sunrise, because if you go early enough there are no security guards. Somehow, I managed to forget to take a picture of the sunrise, but I did take a picture of the stone slides. Good job Mikie. Later four of us hopped on a bus to go to Puno to see Lake Titicaca, starting our week and a half long adventure. The lake is very cool to hear about, but sadly less impressive to see. It is incredible that South America’s second largest lake is 4000m above sea level and has floating islands, but after spending a day boating around it is nice, but definitely not incredibly impressive. Maybe it’s because I grew up on the ocean… who knows. On the bus ride to Puno I lost my phone, so all of the pictures I have are curtesy of my friend Nathalie (THANK YOU). After a night in Puno we headed for La Paz where we spent a few days! The first three pictures are of each of these events – the stone slides, Lake Titicaca, and La Paz on the bus ride in.</p>

    <p>Two of our group went back to Cusco, partly because they had to get back to the after school project, and partly because the American would have had to pay a lot to just enter Bolivia. Nathalie and I continued on, and checked in at the Wild Rover. We had planned on going on the Death Road bike tour the next morning, but there was a miscommunication so we had to wait a day before doing it. We explored La Paz, got some great food and took a cable car over the whole city, but the really incredible part of La Paz was definitely when we eventually got to do Death Road. Biking down the world’s most dangerous road on sketchy bikes and equipment that’s not that great at ridiculously fast speeds is pretty thrilling. Made me miss when I used to go downhill biking. We got a group shot at the start, then our guide took most the pictures.</p>

    <p>It started on a nice standard road at 4700m, and it was all downhill. We flew down the first section was cool because we started above the clouds and went down through them. Once we actually arrived at the Death Road part, we all knew. It was a dirt road with a remarkably low amount of safety.</p>

    <p>We swerved around corner after corner, even passing several cars. It is the only road in Bolivia where cars have to drive on the left hand side, because it is so narrow that the drivers must be able to look out the window to see how close they are to the edge if another car is coming by.  The picture of us sitting on the edge of the cliff isn’t just one special spot on the road, most of it is like that. It was a bit of a cloudy day, but still gorgeous.</p>

    <p>After this we took a long over night bus ride to Uyuni for the Salar de Uyuni (Salt Flats) tour. 3 days of clear blue sky, truly remarkable. The first stop was the train cemetery, which I still don’t really fully know what it is, but it was cool.</p>

    <p>The second stop was the place that everyone knows about. The stunning salt flats. Salt as far as you can see, where the horizon is a gorgeous intersection of clear blue and white.</p>

    <p>There were even some cool islands along the way, with cacti!</p>

    <p>That night we stayed at a hotel made completely of salt, and it was crazy how cold it got. Something like -25˚C in the nights, and +20˚C in the day. I was totally unprepared for how cold it was going to be, but it was alright. Next day we got up quite early and went off again in the jeep with our Bolivian tour guide (only Spanish speaking). Went off for a tour of a bunch of different lakes including a green one, and a red one, because of some weird algae thing going on. Regardless, it was gorgeous and I’m missing some pictures of them sadly. There were even some flamingos!</p>

    <p>We kicked off the last day in gorgeous hot springs (no pictures), then carried on to a few more locations. The last two pictures were at a pretty cool spot. Yeah it’s just a railway, but from that spot you can see mountains in Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile. After this was a brutally long bus ride (42 hours total travel time) back to Cusco for two days before heading back to Newfoundland.</p>
