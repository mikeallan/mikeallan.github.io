            <h3><i>Who is Mike Allan?</i></h3>
            <p>Mike Allan is an ambitious and driven student enrolled at Western University, originally from the fantastic province of Newfoundland. He is pursuing a degree in Mechatronic Systems Engineering while concurrently completing an Honors in Business Administration from the Ivey Business School as a <a href="http://loranscholar.ca" target="_blank">Loran Scholar.</a> While having an overloaded course load, he has managed to mantain a 3.84 GPA.</p>
            <p>He has always enjoyed being busy &#8212; in his senior year of high school he was a member of four senior sport teams, four school choirs, one community choir, three school bands, one community band, coached a volleyball team, worked two part time jobs, all the while completing two AP courses in school. All of this is just an example of the time managing he has had to do throughout the years.</p>
            <p>He describes himself by the George Roter coined phrase &#8212; a "pragmatic idealist" because he does not think the polarity of realism vs. idealism should be a dichotomy. His work with Engineers Without Borders Canada has played a significant role in his personal development, both at his university's chapter and throughout his time working at the National Office in the summer of 2014.</p>
            <p>He has passions for a variety of different things, including surgical robotics, athletics, music, languages, and international development. He has had great success with intramurals at Western, earning four championships in four seasons (two from Ultimate Frisbee, one from Volleyball, and one from Innertube Water Polo). He keeps up his passion for music with frequent jam sessions with friends, and regularly attending concerts. He studied French for six years in school, and is studying Spanish in Peru for the summer of 2015. In seven words, his reason for describing why he believes in international development is "one's birthplace should not limit one's opportunities."</p>
            <p>Mike is striving to find a way to amalgamate his passions for business, technology, and social justice. To contact him, please head over to the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page.</p>

            <h3><i>What is Mike currently doing?</i></h3>
            <p>Mike is enjoying his third year of studies at Western University in London, Ontario. He is currently enrolled in the HBA1 program at the Ivey Business School so this year he is solely studying business. In his spare time he is an executive with the campus chapter of Engineers Without Borders, a member in the campus salsa club, a member of an intramural volleyball team and an intramural Ultimate Frisbee team, and a member in the Ivey Entrepreneurship Club and the Ivey Technology Club. Off campus he keeps up his guitar playing, Rubik's cubing, and programming - currently working through the Codeacademy course in Ruby.</p>
