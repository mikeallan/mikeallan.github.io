				<p><b>Hello there!</b> Welcome to my page to accompany my application for the Associate Product Owner position at Scotiabank. I'm excited to be applying for this position. I created this webpage along with the rest of my website from scratch, with no preset templates (except for the landing page - that was bootstrapped...) Anyways, let me tell you a bit about myself, what makes me excited about this position, and why I am a great fit!</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="one">
			<div class="first-text">
				<h4><em>"Why are you interested in this position?"</em></h4>
				<p>It’s an exciting time to be in the financial sector. We are already seeing significant changes with how people interact with banks. With threats from powerful companies such as Amazon and Facebook, banks need to be innovating and rethinking how things have always be done to ensure success against these potential new entrants. That’s why Scotiabank’s Associate Product Owner position is so intriguing to me. I want to be a leader in this revolutionary change. I spoke with Eric Bujold (a current APO) about this position and what the team is trying to do, and it made me even more excited about this opportunity.</p>

			<div class="second-text">
				<h4><em>"Wait, who are you again?"</em></h4>
				<p>I am originally from Newfoundland, and even though I have been to 15 countries, it remains my favourite place in the world. I received the <a href="http://www.loranscholar.ca" target="_blank">Loran Scholarship</a> in 2013, and moved to Ontario to start school at Western University. I chose to pursue my interest in business, problem solving, and science, enrolling in the dual degree program of Engineering and Business. Now, I'm in my fifth year and am excited to finish school and get out into the real world.

				<h4><em>"Got it. Did you go home for your summers?"</em></h4>
				<p>Nope! Loran has <a href="http://www.loranscholar.ca/loran-award/#summer-internships" target="_blank">summer requirements</a>, so I barely went home in the summer time. My first summer, I worked for Engineers Without Borders Canada, and I was responsible for setting the strategy for the newest portfolio &#8212 Food Systems. I developed <a href="http://my2.ewb.ca/library/collection/311/food-systems-in-canada/" target="_blank">several resources</a>, and really enjoyed living in Toronto. The next summer brought me down to Cusco, Peru, where I worked with <a href="http://www.fairservices-peru.org/" target="_blank">Fairservices-Peru</a> as the Sports Coordinator at an after school program. This position was application based at the time. The next summer, I won the <a href="https://www.cansbridgefellowship.com/" target="_blank">Cansbridge Fellowship</a> (a national entrepreneurially-focused fellowship) which brought me to Shenzhen, China. I worked with Husky Energy, and my task was to come up with some form of automated reporting system through VBA and SQL. I completed this, and it is still being used by top company executives. I presented my project to the COO and several VPs. The coolest part, was that the first time real data was put into my system, we found a $23 million error in reporting that was promptly fixed.

			<div class="fourth-text">
				<h4><em>"That sounds great! Did you get to travel too? And what did you do last summer?"</em></h4>
				<p>I most definitely took the chance to travel! When in South America I went north to Guayaquil, Ecuador and into Mancora, Peru for a bit, and after I finished work went south into Bolivia and saw Lake Titicaca, and the Salt Flats in Uyuni. When in Asia I travelled around China on weekends, and after finishing work I went to Thailand and Laos for a total of three weeks.</p>
				<p>This past summer I wanted to experience working at a startup with exposure to management, and working on interesting projects. I joined FundThrough, a Toronto based startup for the summer as the Partnerships Manager. I created many different systems to enable the management of existing partners with ease. I have continued working with FundThrough part time, and am doing some coding work in relation to both partner and investor report automation.</p>

				<h4><em>"Cool! So what do you do when you're at school and not in class?"</em></h4>
				<p>Glad you asked! I have spent a lot of my time working with Engineers Without Borders (EWB), and was the chapter president last year leading a team of 37 executives and over 100 general members. Through EWB, I became involved with fair trade, and was a driving force behind making Western a Fair Trade Campus, and am still the co-chair of the Fair Trade Campus Steering Committee. My efforts in fair trade advocacy at Western led to the Executive Director of the <a href="http://cftn.ca/">Canadian Fair Trade Network</a> (CFTN) asking me to join their board of directors. I have been on the board since February, 2016.</p>

				<p>Aside from EWB and Fair Trade, I still try and be involved in other things. I was the Campus Ambassador for the Cansbridge Fellowship, as well as the co-director of Corporate Sponsorships, through which I doubled the number of applications from Western, and aided in the organization securing $100,000 of funding over two years. I was also a residence advisor in my second year, and have been a mentor in engineering and a speaker on open house panels. On top of these things, I also served as the chair of the Loran Scholars Assocaition for two years.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately, as you can imagine doing two degrees, school takes up a lot of my time. When not doing things with school or the aforementioned extra-curriculars, I spend my time coding, playing sports (mainly volleyball and ultimate Frisbee), playing music, Rubik's cubing, salsa dancing, and hanging out with friends.</p>

			<div class="sixth-text">
				<h4><em>"Tell us more about that coding you do? Any interesting projects?"</em></h4>
				<p>Quite obviously, this website was one project I worked on! When I was in Peru I bought a domain, and just started working on it. Wanted to have a little blog, but learn something at the same time, and this was the result. Lots of CSS and HTML learned in the process, along with lots of messy code throughout that I have not had time to go and fix.</p>

				<p>I have had a few other things, but my favourite was definitely a system I built at Hack Western. It was essentially Siri on a hotline. This was useful because in places like Sub Saharan Africa, internet access is not that common but mobile phone access is. So, our idea was to create a platform where anyone could call in to a hotline number, ask a question, and get a text back with the answer. We piloted the idea with Google Maps and directions, and finished this much in the Hackathon. Afterwards, we continued and got the Wolfram Alpha API working. We got in contact with a Ghanaian NGO, but things did not end up panning out unfortunately.</p>

				<h4><em>"That sounds neat, but too bad. Any other things you do?"</em></h4>
				<p>I love the outdoors. I try to get out and hike when I can, but it's tricky, especially in Ontario when I don't have a car. Still though, I do what I can. During this past summer I got out around Hamilton and Newfoundland, but before the summer I was down in San Francisco for the annual Cansbridge Fellowship Conference, and went to Yosemite for a few days before the conference started.</p>

			<div class="eigth-text">
				<h4><em>"That's awesome, always good to get some fresh air. Say, what do you think of this whole 'get out of your comfort zone' thing?"</em></h4>
				<p>In my eyes, there's not much use in "stepping out of your comfort zone," because how much time is there in a step? You need to throw yourself out of it, do something that some people would consider crazy. I moved to a school where I knew one person. I went to a continent where I didn't speak the language, or know anyone, twice! I went bungee jumping in Peru and rode death road in Bolivia and I am afriad of heights. I've gotten so used to being uncomfortable, that every time I am comfortable I feel like I need to push myself to do something new, unfamiliar, weird, etc.</p>

				<h4><em>"That makes sense. This all sounds pretty neat, but why should we hire you?"</em></h4>
				<p>I'm passionate about learning, and I get things done. My whole life I have loved solving puzzles, from simple math when I was young to Sudoku in later years, and since first year I've enjoyed Rubik's cubes and other mind games. I don't do anything half-heartedly. I have the energy, drive, and experience to deal with ambiguity and figure out how to succeed. I would be a great fit at Scotiabank, and think I would bring a lot to your team.</p>
